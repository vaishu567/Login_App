Title: LOGIN_APP is a MERN Stack Authentication and User Management App

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a secure and user-friendly web application that allows users to register, log in, verify their identity through OTP (One-Time Password) verification, and reset their password if needed. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used for authentication and authorization purposes.

Key Features:

User Registration: Users can sign up for an account by providing their email address, password, and other necessary information.

Email Verification: After registration, an email with an OTP is sent to the user's registered email address. The user needs to enter the OTP to verify their email.

Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password.

JWT Authentication: Upon successful login, the server issues a JWT token that is used to authenticate and authorize the user for protected routes and actions.

Password Reset: Users can request a password reset if they forget their password. A password reset link is sent to their registered email address, allowing them to set a new password.

User Profile: Users can update their profile information.

Dashboard: A personalized dashboard that displays user-specific information or activities.

Logout: Users can log out securely, invalidating their JWT token.

Error Handling: Proper error handling and validation for user inputs.


Components:

Frontend: Developed using React.js, with components for registration, login, OTP verification, password reset, user profile, and dashboard.

Backend: Built with Express.js and Node.js, responsible for user authentication, OTP generation and verification, sending emails for verification and password reset, and managing user data in MongoDB.

Database: MongoDB used to store user data.

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) used for authentication and authorization.

Email Service: Integration with an email service (e.g., SendGrid, Nodemailer) to send verification emails and password reset links.

Tools and Libraries:

React Router: Used for client-side routing.

Express Validator: For input validation on the server side.

Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.

Nodemailer or SendGrid: For sending emails.

JWT Library: For creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.

Bcrypt: For hashing and salting passwords before storing them in the database.
